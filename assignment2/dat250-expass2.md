# Assignment 2

There were no problems when installing JPA

Code:
![Experiment 1](jpabasic)
![Experiment 2](creditcard)

I inspected the database using IntelliJs database explorer:
![Database Explorer](assets/database.png)
![Database Explorer](assets/database2.png)

Tables that were created:
* ADDRESS
* ADDRESS\_PERSON
* BANK
* CREDITCARD
* PERSON
* PINCODE


Issues:
I could not get lombok to work for a while, but later realized i had to install a lombok plugin to get it to work in the IDE.
