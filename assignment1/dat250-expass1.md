# DAT250: Assignment 1 report

Since i already had all the required software, there were no issues. I am familiar with Java, Maven and Git. And regularly use IntelliJ as IDE. Since i have used all of these programs before, i felt no need to validate that they work, as they have worked before. There were no issues encountered while following the heroku installation or tutorial, as they were straight forward to follow. There are no pending issues that i did not manage to solve.
